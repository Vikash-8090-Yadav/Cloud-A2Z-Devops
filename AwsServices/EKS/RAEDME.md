# AWS EKS

**What is AWS EKS?**

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS. With EKS, you can focus on building and running your applications without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.

**Features**

* **Managed Kubernetes control plane:** EKS manages the Kubernetes control plane for you, so you don't have to worry about installing, configuring, or patching Kubernetes.
* **Highly available:** EKS clusters are highly available, with three master nodes running in different Availability Zones.
* **Scalable:** EKS clusters can be scaled up or down as needed.
* **Secure:** EKS clusters are secure by default, with features like encryption and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Getting started with EKS

To get started with EKS, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an AWS account.
2. Install the AWS CLI.
3. Create an EKS cluster.
4. Deploy your applications.

### Create an AWS account

You can create an AWS account for free by visiting the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/).

### Install the AWS CLI

The AWS CLI is a command-line tool that you can use to interact with AWS services. You can install the AWS CLI for your operating system by following the instructions in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cli.html).

### Create an EKS cluster

You can create an EKS cluster using the AWS CLI or the [EKS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home).

### Deploy your applications

Once you have created an EKS cluster, you can deploy your applications to the cluster using kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool.

For more detailed instructions on how to get started with EKS, please see the [EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html).
